    "\n",
    "Automation can be <span style=\"color:#43c6ac\">used for a variety of tasks</span>, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:lightgreen\">**Data processing:** </span> <br>\n",
    "We can automatically collect and process data from different sources, such as text files, databases, and websites. <br>\n",
    "For example, Python scripts can be written to extract data from a mineral deposit database or to download and process data from a seismic log file. This not only saves time but also reduces human error in data handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:lightgreen\">**Data analysis:** </span> <br>\n",
    "There are numerous libraries and tools for data analysis, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. <br>\n",
    "These libraries allow large datasets to be analyzed efficiently and automatically. <br>\n",
    "For example, Python scripts can be used to analyze data from a set of rock samples and extract statistical information about their properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Advanced automation techniques using machine learning can be applied to identify patterns and make predictions based on geological data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:lightgreen\">**Results visualization:** </span> <br>\n",
    "There are also powerful libraries for data visualization, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. <br>\n",
    "These libraries make it easy and quick to create graphs and interactive visualizations. <br>\n",
    "Python scripts can be used to automatically generate data visualizations, such as geological maps, drilling profiles, and terrain models. These visualizations help interpret the data more intuitively and communicate findings effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:lightgreen\">**Report generation:** </span> <br>\n",
    "Python can also be used to automatically generate reports. Python scripts can process the results of data analysis and visualization and automatically generate reports in different formats, such as PDF, HTML, and Excel. <br>\n",
    "For example, laboratory analysis reports can be automatically generated from the results of a set of rock samples, including graphs, tables, and statistical summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:lightgreen\">**Continuous monitoring:** </span> <br>\n",
    "Automated scripts can be used to continuously monitor geological sensors, such as seismographs or pressure measurement devices, and alert about unusual events in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:lightgreen\">**Simulations and modeling:** </span> <br>\n",
    "Automating geological simulations, such as groundwater flow or volcanic eruption modeling, makes it possible to run multiple scenarios quickly and adjust parameters efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:lightgreen\">**Database maintenance:** </span> <br>\n",
    "Automation can help keep geological databases updated, ensuring that the data is always available and accurate for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:lightgreen\">**Automation of repetitive tasks:** </span> <br>\n",
    "Repetitive and tedious tasks, such as file format conversion or data cleaning, can be automated to increase efficiency and reduce the likelihood of errors."
